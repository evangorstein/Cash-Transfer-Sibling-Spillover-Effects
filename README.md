# Cash-Transfer-Sibling-Spillover-Effects

This repo contains code forming a matched sample among the children who signed up for Colombia's conditional cash transfer program designed to incentivize secondary educational enrollment. I formed the match for the purpose of testing for a spillover effect among siblings, attempting to replicate the findings of F. Barrera-Osorio, L. Linden, and J. Saavedra in Section 5 of [this paper](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/sites/default/files/research-paper/Conditional\%20Cash\%20Transfers\%20April\%2011.pdf). We consider those families in which two siblings signed up for the program, one of whom was not selected and we match children with a selected sibling with children without a selected sibling for the purpose of evaluating the effect of having a sibling in the program on educational outcomes (attendance and enrollment). We form our match using a caliper on propensity scores and otherwise minimizing the sum of a robust Mahalanobis distance on the covariate vectors between pairs. We first do so without special attention paid to gender, and then we form an exact match on gender. The spread of standardized differences before and after the two matches is displayed in `StandDifferences.png`.
